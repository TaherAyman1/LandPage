                <p class="white p-4 medium-font">
                    Myofunctional Postural Rehabilitation (M.P.R.) is an important tool in the diagnosis and treatment
                    of neuro-musculo-skeletal dysfunctions. This consists in balancing the craniocervical-mandibular-
                    postural system with the rest of the body, that is, with the postural tonic system. This method is
                    successfully used in young patients during and after the growth phase, as well as in dysfunctional
                    adults where many TMJ pathologies must be corrected in balance with the rest of the body. This
                    method rehabilitates altered postural receptors, establishes skeletal-muscle balance, corrects
                    neuromuscular dysfunctions, impaired growth, and mandibular position, allowing to reach a
                    balanced posture, thus obtaining functional and lasting treatments, without recurrence and, above
                    all, without postural alterations. The course covers the methods used in diagnosing and treating

                            manner its functions in an organized way, I now understand that an alteration

                            it.This new philosophy of diagnosis and global treatment has allowed better results
                            with therapies, which translates into greater biopsychosocial well-being
                            for patients by promoting not only oral, but a global rehabilitation. This new way of
                            understanding and applying anatomy, physiology and treatment has allowed me to
                            analyze and look beyond jost the dental part, to see the individual in a holistic way.
                            Through questioning and clinical examination, I obtain information that allows me to
                            have a systemic idea of the problems to be solved and its causes. By integrating
                            concepts from different medical specialties I am able to restore the balance of the
